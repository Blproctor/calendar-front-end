# Capstone Full Stack Application Project

## Upcoming Events App

The Upcoming Events app functions as a single page application using HTML and CSS for styling. The client side is written in Javascript with the jQuery library and Handlebars templating. The [back end](https://protected-hamlet-58469.herokuapp.com/) is written utilizing Express Mongoose and a MongoDB database.

## Development Process

I started creating this app.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to sign up, sign in, change my password, and sign out.
2. As a user, I want to be able to create an event at a certain time on a specific day of the week.
3. As a user, I want to be able to read/see the events that I previously created.
4. As a user, I want to be able to update the name, day, and time of an event that was previously created.
5. As a user, I want to be able to delete an event.

## Unsolved Problems and Reach Goals

1. Update Functionality: 

2. Smartphone compatibility: I would like to edit the app to allow for a more user friendly experience on mobile devices.

3. Search feature: I would like to create a search option on the page for the user to be able to find an event by the 
event name, id, date, and/or time.

4.
